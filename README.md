### This shell bash script simply displays colorful ASCII kitties.

The script randomly selects one from a pool of 10 hardcoded ASCII cats and then displays it in a dynamically selected color from a pool of over 16 million colors. Additionally, a randomly selected kitty receives the word "meow" individually colored with a random color.

### Instalation ...
```
git clone https://github.com/BuriXon-code/shell-kitties
cd shell-kitties
chmod +x kitties
```
### Usage ...
```
./kitties
```
or
```
./kitties <count>
```

 
> [!TIP]
> The script accepts a parameter that is a number. The entered number becomes the number of kitties displayed. The parameter is optional.

## Be amazed by kitties!
